# ~ Learning Selenium with Java ~

### Description
I love learning new things but I can't help forgetting some. This is why I do this short summaries in a 'cheatsheet' like manner, to be able to keep all important details in one place. 

**NOTE**

While learning about Selenium, I have found "Selenium WebDriver with Java - Basics to Advanced" Course on Udemy to be very useful. [Check it out](https://www.udemy.com/selenium-real-time-examplesinterview-questions/learn/v4/overview)!
